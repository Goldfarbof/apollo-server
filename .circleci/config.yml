          # Due to a bug, npm upgrades from the version of npm that ships with
          # Node.js 6 (npm v3.10.10) go poorly and generally causes other problems
          # with the environment.  Since yarn is already available here we can just
          # use that to work-around the issue.  It's possible that npm cleanup might
          # prevent this from being necessary, but this installation can be switched
          # to use `npm` (rather than `yarn`) once Node 6 is no longer tested below.

  # These are the steps used for each version of Node which we're testing
  # against.  Thanks to YAMLs inability to merge arrays (though it is able
  # to merge objects), every version of Node must use the exact same steps,
  # or these steps would need to be repeated in a version of Node that needs
  # something different.  Probably best to avoid that, out of principle, though.
